The idea is that the person will be able to move around the Compute canada Clusters and be more or less comfortable with it. It is by no means comprehensive nor is going to make you a bash ninja, but it will allow you to deal with clusters, and some minor manipulations.\n",

SSH stands for Secure SHell (shell is the terminal), and you just have to type `ssh username@clustername.computecanada.ca`, where `username` is your own username in Compute Canada and `clustername` is the name of the cluster. I believe most of use use Graham or Cedar. In this tutorial I'll assume we will be working in graham. "
