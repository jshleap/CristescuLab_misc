    "# A Very very Basic BASH tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This very basic tutorial is to introcuce a complete novice in the use of bash. The idea is that the person will be able to move around the Compute canada Clusters and be more or less comfortable with it. It is by no means comprehensive nor is going to make you a bash ninja, but it will allow you to deal with clusters, and some minor manipulations.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you work in windows you will need to install an ssh-enabled terminal like [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [putty](https://www.putty.org/). This tutorial will asume you already have installed and read the instructions of your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MAC and linux users, just search for terminal, and voila!\n",
    "\n",
    "## SSH: Connecting to the cluster\n",
    "Since most of this tutorial is meant to help you use the Compute Canada clusters, I'll start with the connection. SSH stands for Secure SHell (shell is the terminal), and you just have to type `ssh username@clustername.computecanada.ca`, where `username` is your own username in Compute Canada and `clustername` is the name of the cluster. I believe most of use use Graham or Cedar. In this tutorial I'll assume we will be working in graham. "
